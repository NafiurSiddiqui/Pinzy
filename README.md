# Pinzy

Welcome to Pinzy. This is a web GIS social media app. Create pins with your message to the globe and raise awarness, build a bridge between you and your customers, easily create your event and send your message across the globe.

⚠️ Not the life time's achievement but honest work.

# Starting the project

- clone or download the repo
- Spin up the XAMPP
- install `live-server` chrome extension. Put the actual path of the proejct folder inside the `actual server` field and click apply, toggle the `live-reload` on.
- Have `php-server` extesnion on vscode.
- Now spin up the `go live` and `serve php` from the `index.php` file. close both of them. visit `localhost/<path to your projects>`. for instance, mine `localhost/projects/pintzy` which lives inside the `htdocs` on windows.

# Technical aspects

## frontend 🧑‍💻

- custom client-side auth logic, escaping fishy chars like script execution from client-side and sanitizing user input in general.
- Debouncing for the form (pin submission) validation boosting performance.
- Used fontAwesome locally due to CORS issue by fa scripts.
- Guest users are stored in localstoarge **Plz delete all pin** before logging out and free your localstorage. I will implement algorithm with expiry date set along the data later on.
- Tailwind css is used for flexibility, maintenance and fast development.

## Backend 🧑‍💻

- custom Auth logic, used PDO and param binding for SQL-injection prevention and input clean up.
- custom RestAPI for fetching data
- signed users are stored in the mysql db with unlimited pin privilege.
- custom _htaccess_ to force the use of _SSL_ certificates otherwise, some browsers won't let it locate your position.

This is not a production ready app to tackle huge user interaction but a demo webapp for the future ( next verion ) Pinzy release and to solidify my understanding of _MVC_, _OOP_ with vanilla **JS**, **Php** and **MySql**.

## Thrid party

- Leaflet JS 🍃
- Tailwind
- fontAwesome

## Noticeable BUGS and third-party issue 🐛

- This application uses Leaflet and openstreet map which, in worst cases like slow internet, is noticed to have extremely slow peroformance. The initial load of the map takes too long.
- Using it one browser sometimes won't load the map for some reason idk yet.Especially sometimes having trouble loading the map and pins on Microsoft Edge even though cache are diabled. 🤔
- Upon signup or login sometimes pin is not submitted to backend.Needs once or twice refreshing before you can submit the pin. 🐛

Latter two bugs are soemthing I will be working on to fix.If you notice the possible issue please notify me or make a pull request. I would be grateful to you. 🙏

## Live-demo

[Demo 🔗](https://www.pinzy-demo.rf.gd/)

**Please note** that this project is hosted on a free webhosting provider, like infinity free, which has restricted database, meaning usage of _PUT_ and _DELETE_ method is not applicable. Hence, the live-demo is limited to user signup and creation of the pin only.
